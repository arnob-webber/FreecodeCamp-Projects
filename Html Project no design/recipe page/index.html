        Recipe for chicken noodles with video and step-by-step photos. For a
        dinner or weekend meal, these easy Indo-Chinese chicken noodles can be
        made in a matter of minutes. Indo chinese dishes are a fusion of Indian
        and Chinese cuisines that originated in Indian Chinese households. These
        foods are quite popular in India and are served in most Indo Chinese
        restaurants in India and abroad. Therefore, this recipe for chicken
        noodles is not the genuine Chinese chicken chow mein. But it sure yields
        a bowl of very good chicken noodles and is very easily adaptable to suit
        ones taste buds.

        One can find so many variations of chicken noodles in restaurants each
        one being distinct from the other in taste and appearance. It is
        impossible to replicate the smoky flavor of Chinese food at home, no
        matter how hard we try. But still the choice of noodles, oil, sauces and
        more importantly the wok used bring in all the special flavor and taste
        to the final dish. I've used wheat-based ramen noodles, but you can use
        any kind you want. I have used organic soya sauce and chilli sauce.
        Anything you like can replace the chilli sauce. For the marination, I
        used five spice powder, which can be replaced with garam masala to suit
        Indian tastes.
